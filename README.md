Envoy
=====

A e-mail chess client for OS X that sends and receives moves through the Mail.app.  
  
Envoy is a simple chess client that enforces the rules. In addition, if you fill out the player email details you can e-mail your move to the other player and receieve their move back. Doing this require you to have the Apple Mail application setup with a valid account. If that is the case, Envoy will generate the email and send it and if you look for new moves it will search your Inbox (or specified folder) for Envoy generated emails from the current game.  
  
Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) broke Envoy for some reason and it has not yet been fixed.  It should still work on OS X 10.6 and 10.7.
